Creation of This Website,http://r.yihui.name/,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>Personally I don't like those complicated mathematical theories... And I believe many people hold the same opinion with me. I want to find some simpler approaches to learn statistics. That's my original motivation to create such a website.</p><p>Sure, I'm too lazy. Simulation and graphics alone cannot contribute to mathematics and statistics directly. So, we should face the reality anyway... We should <em>prove</em> the effect of gradient descent algorithm <em>X<sub>n+1</sub> = X<sub>n</sub> - &gamma;F'(X<sub>n</sub>)</em> instead of just giving an illustration. </p>","Sat, 06 Oct 2007 00:00:00 GMT",1,Web
The Way of Animation Found,http://r.yihui.name/misc/java.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>I spent really a lot of time on searching for a proper way for animations. After <a href=""../misc/gif_pdf_grDev.htm"">several trials</a>, I found <a href=""../misc/java.htm"">JavaScript could help me</a>. <acronym title=""The HTML Document Object Model"">HTML DOM</acronym> is really important. </p><p>Cheers! Users won't need R or any other special programs to see my animations now -- just a browser supporting JavaScript is enough. </p>","Sun, 14 Oct 2007 00:00:00 GMT",2,Technique
K-Means Cluster Analysis Added,http://r.yihui.name/stat/multivariate_stat/kmeans/index.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>The algorithm for &quot;<a href=""../stat/multivariate_stat/kmeans/index.htm"">K-Means Cluster Analysis</a>&quot; is simple. I haven't write down the theories about this analysis yet. </p>","Mon, 15 Oct 2007 00:00:01 GMT",3,Animation
Bootstrapping Added,http://r.yihui.name/stat/machine_learning/bootstrapping/index.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>I'm not so content with the current animation for <a href=""../stat/machine_learning/bootstrapping/index.htm"">bootstrapping</a>. I should use some  data from the real world and change the way of animations. </p>","Wed, 17 Oct 2007 00:00:02 GMT",4,Animation
Introduction to R,http://r.yihui.name/intro/index.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>This is just <a href=""../intro/index.htm"">a personal introduction</a>, including installation, functions, documentations and R help.

A Talk on Animations in Statistics,http://www.yihui.name/cv/,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>Today I gave a talk on the 2nd postgraduate forum on statistics for universities in Beijing, and my topic is &quot;<em><a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/animation.html"" target=""_blank"">Animation</a> in Statistics: Dynamic Graphics for Statistical Models and Practical Applications</em>&quot;. It seems that they are both interested and amazed very much. My <a href=""http://www.yihui.name/cv/images/animation_2nd_stat_forum_yihui.pdf"">slides</a> can be downloaded from my <a href=""http://www.yihui.name/cv/"" target=""_blank"">resume page</a>. </p>","Wed, 12 Dec 2007 00:00:04 GMT",6,Misc
Function highlight.def() for Highlight,http://r.yihui.name/misc/highlight.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>Ultimately I finished a special function<em> highlight.def()</em> for creating the R definition file in the software <a href=""http://www.andre-simon.de"" target=""_blank"">Highlight</a>. So the section &quot;<a href=""../misc/highlight.htm"">Highlight R Code</a>&quot; is also completed. </p>","Tue, 13 Dec 2007 00:00:05 GMT",7,Misc
'animation' Updated to 0.1-3,http://r.yihui.name/gr/animation/index.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>During the last month I have been writing the package 'animation', so I didn't update this web site. Now the lasted version is 0.1-3, containing 20 functions for creating animations and fulfilling other miscellaneous ideas; just use <em>ani.news()</em> to check the news. Now the package contains the following animated demonstrations: bootstrapping for i.i.d data, brownian motion, buffon's needle, k-fold cross-validation, flipping 'coins', k-means cluster algorithm, k-NN algorithm, moving window auto-regression and the four basic sampling schemes (simple random sampling without replacement, stratified sampling, cluster sampling and systematic sampling). </p>","Sat, 15 Dec 2007 00:00:06 GMT",8,R
Updating Examples in This Web Site,http://r.yihui.name/,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com",<p>This site hasn't been updated for more than a month... I have to modify and add some content now. </p>,"Mon, 17 Dec 2007 00:00:07 GMT",9,Web
Installation of R and add-on packages,http://r.yihui.name/intro/install/index.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>The <a href=""http://r.yihui.name/intro/install/index.htm"">installation page</a> has been finished. Actually I don't think this is a good introduction... You should refer to other documents such as <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.pdf"">R-admin</a> or <a href=""http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/peter.rossi/research/bayes%20book/bayesm/Making%20R%20Packages%20Under%20Windows.pdf"">&quot;Making R Packages Under Windows&quot;</a>, etc. By the way, I have also changed my plan for writing introductions to R, since I saw some excellent materials these days, for example, the web site created by <a href=""http://www.statmethods.net/about/author.html"" target=""_blank"">Robert I. Kabacoff</a> at <a href=""http://www.statmethods.net"" target=""_blank"">http://www.statmethods.net</a>.</p>","Tue, 22 Jan 2008 15:16:00 GMT",10,R
Create Movies with ImageMagick,http://r.yihui.name/misc/gif_pdf_grDev.htm,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>On second thoughts, I decided to include the format of GIF into my package (see the function <em>saveMovie()</em>), but the generating of GIF animations needs the (free) software &quot;<a href=""http://www.imagemagick.org"">ImageMagick</a>&quot; to be installed. Maybe somebody likes GIF better than HTML animation pages. In fact we can even create MPEG movies because this format is also supported by ImageMagick.</p><p>This function is available in <font face=""Courier New, Courier, monospace""><a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/animation.html"" target=""_blank"">animation</a></font> v0.1-6. See the help file for details. </p>

Some Examples of Probability and Computational Statistics,http://r.yihui.name/,"Yihui Xie, xieyihui[at]gmail.com","<p>I'm just toooo busy to synchronize  this website with my package <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html"" target=""_blank"">animation</a>... Today I spent a few hours on adding four examples in Probability Theory and Compuational Statistics. I hope somebody can help me update this site. </p>","Sat, 26 Apr 2008 23:54:01 GMT",12,Web

I will stop updating <a href=""http://r.yihui.name"" target=""_blank"">http://R.yihui.name</a> and in future my efforts will be mainly made on ""AniWiki"".
