# animation

The old website of the R package [**animation**](https://github.com/yihui/animation) was built on DokuWiki, and it was hard to maintain. Now we convert it to Jekyll/Github and R Markdown. It has been [integrated](http://vis.supstat.com/categories.html#Animation-ref) into Vistat: http://vis.supstat.com
